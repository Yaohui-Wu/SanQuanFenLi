* SanQuanFenLi is the Chinese meaning of separation of the three powers in English.
* The first "Quan" is the password, the second "Quan" is the key table, the third "Quan" is the avalanche table.
* The second-"Quan" key table uses the "JunTai" distribution algorithm to generate random numbers.
* The so-called "JunTai" distribution algorithm refers to the disorderly distribution of each number on the axis of the number, its value appears only once without repetition.
* The third-"Quan" avalanche table can have a large number of bytes, 8 bytes, 16 bytes, 32 bytes, or even as large as infinite.
* It is necessary to have these three "Quan" at the same time in order to be encrypted an decrypted, which is the reason for the name "SanQuanFenLi".
* So, it's not a single one can be omitted.

* This is just a demo version, the official version is also low-level, intermediate, premium version. There are also enhanced and final versions.
* The final version uses AI to be encrypted and decrypted. It's super complex. It's estimated that the super computer can't crack it.
* If you need source code, please contact me.
* I hope who can crack it one day in my lifetime.
