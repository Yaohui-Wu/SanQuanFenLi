SanQuanFenLi is the Chinese meaning of separation of the three powers in English.
The first "Quan" is the password, the second "Quan" is the key table, the third "Quan" is the avalanche table.
The second-"Quan" key table uses the "JunTai" distribution algorithm to generate random numbers.
The so-called "JunTai" distribution algorithm refers to the disorderly distribution of each number on the axis of the number, its value appears only once without repetition.
The third-"Quan" avalanche table can have a large number of bytes, 8 bytes, 16 bytes, 32 bytes, or even as large as infinite.
It is necessary to have these three "Quan" at the same time in order to be encrypted an decrypted, which is the reason for the name "SanQuanFenLi". It's not a single one can be omitted.
This is just a demo version, the official version is also low-level, intermediate, premium version. There are also enhanced and ultimate versions. The ultimate version uses AI to be encrypted and decrypted. It's super complex. It's estimated that the supercomputer can't crack it.
