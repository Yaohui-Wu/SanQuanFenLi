* SanQuanFenLi is the Chinese meaning of separation of the three powers in English.
* The first "Quan" is the password, the second "Quan" is the key table, the third "Quan" is the avalanche table.
* The second-"Quan"'s key table uses the "JunTai"(like Shuffle) distribution algorithm to generate random numbers.
* The so-called "JunTai" distribution random number algorithm refers to: each number (integer or real number) is distributed disorderly on the number axis, its value appears only once without repetition.
* The third-"Quan"'s avalanche table can have a large number of bytes, 8 bytes, 16 bytes, 32 bytes, or even as large as infinite.
* It is necessary to have these three "Quan" at the same time in order to be encrypted an decrypted, which is the reason for the name "SanQuanFenLi".
* So, it's not a single one can be omitted.

* It's just a demo version, the official version includes lower version, intermediate version and advanced version.
* If you want to source code of official version, please contact me.
* I hope who can crack this algorithm one day in my lifetime.
* If you break this algorithm, please let me know. Thank you very so much!

* Compiled on MacOS, Linux and *BSD in X86_64 platform.
